--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
    This assignment took me approximately 2 days.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
    I consulted various online resources to complete this assignment. For visual inspiration and design ideas,
    I explored examples provided by the Professor as well as platforms like Pinterest or Google. To understand and implement specific
    technical elements, I referred to educational resources such as W3Schools and MDN Web Docs for guidance on HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. Additionally, I used ChatGPT to troubleshoot issues, refine my code, and clarify concepts, cross-referencing its
    suggestions with other resources to ensure accuracy. The process involved significant trial and error, where I relied on a
    combination of these tools to experiment, debug, and improve the project independently.

5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
     I primarily worked on this assignment independently but shared my progress with a few individuals to showcase my work.
     While I did not actively seek help from classmates, I had a brief discussion with one person about the structured and
     organized nature of HTML and how its meticulous framework allows for logical and efficient development.


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
    There is nothing special required to run my code. The project consists of static
    files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), so it can be served using the command: python3 -m http.server 8000

    Ensure Python 3 is installed, and navigate to the directory containing the project files before running
    the command. Once the server is running, the website can be accessed by opening http://localhost:8000 in
    a browser.
